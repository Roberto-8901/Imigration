      The shutdown of courts has plummeted the immigration judges’ productivity leaving millions of
      immigrants without their case being heard at Immigration courts. </p>

      The closure of immigration courts, according to Trac Immigration, has affected the immigration system after having a dramatic increase since 2010. Today, the pandemic has set a new precedent. Immigration judges in New York City have complete
      273 cases combined as far as July 2020 goes, representing just a fraction of the 2,200 cases completed in July 2019. At this rate, it is unlikely immigration judges will hear the 14,503 new immigration cases filed in New York City's courts in
      the fiscal year 2020.
      <br>
      <br>

      The shutdown has caused immigration judges' productivity to plummet in the busiest courts nationwide including New York, New Jersey, Boston, Texas, and California. At the beginning of 2020, the immigration courts were completing around 40,000
      cases per month, according to DOJ. However, the reality drastically changed in May, June, and July after the number dropped to less than 6,000 per month after immigration hearings were postponed or canceled.

        For the Immigration Attorney, Thomas Cheung, Esq, who represents clients at the Non-Profit organization HANAC, INC stated, "this Backlog will force to postpone the possibility to obtain a legal status leaving them with anxiety because of the
        uncertainty of their future" he said.

        For Lenni B. Benson, distinguished Chair of Immigration and Human Right Law at the New York law School stated that “Immigration hearing keep saying; Hearings are postponed, hearing are postponed, they claimed they can’t manage, they don’t
        want judges to go into the buildings, they don’t have clean air, they don’t have support personal, and My theory is that this administration wanted the backlog.”

      Moreover, Professor Benson stated “Where are all these cases? Houston a judge
      can do 4,000 cases in a year because they do mass hearing and people that were arrested at the border and they quickly deport them to Mexico, but in New York City a case takes three years so I think you need to look a court by court data and
      you need to look who is the population in that court” she said.

      The lack of a responsible measure to the pandemic, and the poor management from our representatives to enforce the guidelines from health specialist have contributed to the death of more than 200.000 in the United States alone. As a result,
      immigration courts have been impacted greatly leaving many without seen an immigration judge for years or longer.
